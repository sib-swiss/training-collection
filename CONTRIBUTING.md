# Contributing

First of all, great that you're considering to contribute. Anything that you can contribute is highly appreciated! :thumbsup::tada:

This documented is inspired by the [carpentries contributing file](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

This project is open source and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
- adding course material
- typos

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can, end help you become a member of our community.

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about course material you would like to add, a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1.  If you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, or are willing to [create one](https://github.com/join), but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue](https://github.com/sib-swiss/training-collection/issues). This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.
2.  If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,  you can submit a pull request (PR). 

## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing contributions and improving existing ones to providing feedback. If you are looking for ideas, please see the 'Issues' tab for  a list of issues associated with this repository.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are smarter together than we are on our own. Reviews from novices and newcomers are particularly valuable: it's easy for people who have been using these courses for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so fresh eyes are always welcome.
